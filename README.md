## ET.02.02 First Problem
Write and test a Persona class that initializes objects with valid states. The data for each Persona object includes name, last name, date of birth, nationality, education, English certification, phone number, and email. Additionally, considering the problem’s semantics, we are interested in including methods that help determine if the person is of legal age and if they are European. Please, to the extent possible, value the management and use of exceptions and the possibility of creating a program that uses the Persona class. In addition to the subsequent semantic considerations of the problem, also take into account the following:

* The user interface will be through the command line. Classes with specific methods for reading from the keyboard and writing strings and numbers to the screen must be developed.
* Use exceptions at those points in the program where it is necessary to control the program flow.
* Do not couple domain classes with the user interface (e.g., do not generate screen outputs in domain logic classes).
